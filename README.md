A collection of random projects


booth1.cpp and RestoreDivision.cpp implement Booth's Algorithm and the Restore Division algorithms from a visual perspective.  Each ask the user to input via the console 16 digit signed integers. The programs then iteratively step through the algorithm and print each step along the way.

These programs are for demonstration purposes only.
