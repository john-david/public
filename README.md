booth1.cpp and RestoreDivision.cpp implement Booth's Algorithm and the Restore Division algorithms from a visual perspective.  Each ask the user to input via the console 16-bit signed integers. The programs then iteratively step through the algorithm and print each step along the way.

The C++ bitset STL library is used.  The library's basic functionality made programming the multiplication and division algorithms extremely easy to implement.  

These programs are for demonstration purposes only.

The ipython notebook was part of a series of projects for a Machine Learning class. The notebook looks at the perceptron algortithm under a series of problems, from easily classified data to data sets that are impossible to split accurately in 2D.
