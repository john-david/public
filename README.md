# public
A collection of random projects.  
This code is for demonstration purposes only.
________

**booth.cpp** and **restoring_division.cpp** implement [Booth's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booth%27s_multiplication_algorithm) and the [Restoring Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm) algorithms from a visual perspective. Each program 
asks the user to input 16-bit signed integers via the console. The programs convert the 16-bit numbers 
into their binary representation and begin to iteratively step through the algorithms. After each step 
the results are printed to console along the way. These programs were designed to show students who might 
be unfamiliar with how to work through these algorithms by hand exactly how every step is represented. 

The C++ bitset STL library was used for these programs.  The library's basic functionality made programming 
the multiplication and division algorithms extremely easy to implement without messy array operations.   

________

The perceptron jupyter notebook was part of a series of projects for a Machine 
Learning class at UMSL. The notebook looks at the [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) algortithm's decision boundary choices using a series of randomly 
generated x/y coordinate pair data sets. The data sets vary from easily classified sets to sets that are impossible to split 
in 2D. It compares different starting weights and whether or not the data set's order affects the algorithm's decision 
boundary.

________

**doggone-it.html** and **doggone-it.css** are the starting components of a fictional dog walking startup landing page. I'll 
add more functionality to this over time.
