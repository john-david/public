A collection of random projects

________

**booth1.cpp** and **RestoreDivision.cpp** implement [Booth's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booth%27s_multiplication_algorithm)
and the [Restoring Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm) algorithms 
from a visual perspective.  
Each program asks the user to input 16-bit signed integers via the console. The programs then iteratively step through the 
algorithms and prints each the results of step along the way.   

The C++ bitset STL library was used for these programs.  The library's basic functionality made programming the multiplication 
and division algorithms extremely easy to implement without messy array operations.   

________

The [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) jupyter notebook was part of a series of projects for a Machine 
Learning class at UMSL. The notebook looks at the perceptron algortithm's decision boundary choices using a series of randomly 
generated x/y coordinate pair data sets. The data sets vary from easily classified sets to sets that are impossible to split 
in 2D. It compares different starting weights and whether or not the data set's order affects the algorithm's decision 
boundary.

________

doggone-it.html and doggone-it.css are the main components of a fictional dog walking startup landing page. I'll add more 
functionality to this over time.
