A collection of random projects


booth1.cpp and RestoreDivision.cpp implement Booth's Algorithm and the Restore Division algorithms from a visual perspective.  Each ask the user to input via the console 16-bit signed integers. The programs then iteratively step through the algorithm and print each step along the way.

These programs are for demonstration purposes only.
