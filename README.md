________

booth1.cpp and RestoreDivision.cpp implement Booth's Algorithm and the Restore Division algorithms from a visual perspective.  
Each ask the user to input via the console 16-bit signed integers. The programs then iteratively step through the algorithm 
and print each step along the way. 

The C++ bitset STL library was used for these programs.  The library's basic functionality made programming the multiplication 
and division algorithms extremely easy to implement.  

________

The perceptron jupyter notebook was part of a series of projects for a Machine Learning class. The notebook looks at the 
perceptron algortithm under a series of problems, from easily classified data to data sets that are impossible to split 
accurately in 2D.

________

doggone-it.html and doggone-it.css are the main components of a fictional dog walking startup landing page. I'll add more 
functionality to this over time.
